This is my blog where I share my paper notes, ML learnings, and any other musings.

## ABOUT
Kate Hajash is a Staff ML Research Engineer at Samsung Research America's (SRA) Think Tank Team. Her research interests include reinforcement learning, robotics, multi-agent environments, and collaborative construction. Prior to joining SRA, she received a dual degree at MIT, with a Master of Science in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Architecture Studies with a focus in Computation and Design. Under the guidance of Prof. Skylar Tibbits and Prof. Patrick Winston, Kate developed multi-agent environments, using reinforcement learning to train collaborative agents to work together to push blocks to specified locations. Prior to her work in multiagent assembly, Kate built a strong research track record in computational design and architecture, developing two novel rapid prototyping processes using industrial robotic arms, a passive air-filtering brick, and a ‘prize-seeking,’ origami-inspired robot. In 2013, Kate graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Her ambition is to use her experience in reinforcement learning, robotics, and architectural design to create collaborative robots that work together to build large-scale structures and can achieve more together than they can alone.
