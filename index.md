Hi, I'm Kate. 👋  I took a wandering path into Machine Learning. I started in Architecture (building architecture 🏗️ not computer architecture 💻 ), got into robotic fabrication and research, and left architecture to study Design Computation and CS at MIT. Now, I'm an Staff ML Research Engineer at Samsung's Think Tank Team. I'm interested reinforcement learning, computer vision, generative methods, and robotics. Overall, I'm really excited about creating AI-based tools that can help people, inspire creativity, or solve problems.

This is my blog where I share my paper notes, ML learnings, and any other musings. 
Check out my website [here](https://katehajash.com/) to see past projects in architecture, design, robotics and a little reinforcement learning.
